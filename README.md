Getting Started
---------------
The simplest way to use this image is by issuing the following command: `docker run -d -p2876:2876 `

Please notice the port configuration in above example.

### Configuration
The Schema-Repo is configured with an _in-memory_ backend as default. If you need to use something different, then pass the `SCHEMA_REPO_BACKEND`
environment variable. Although not available in the documentation, the following are valid options for backend:
* `in-memory`
* `file-system`
* `zookeeper`

Please refer to the [run.sh bash script in schema-repo project](run-bash-script) for further details.


### Healtcheck
The image comes with a very basic healthcheck, but it is enough to get noticed when the container is not providing the schema-repo RESTful API.

Security
--------
Several measures and good practices have been taken into account to protect the Docker container:
* Container run as an ordinary user instead of root.
* SUID flag is removed from container.

Dependencies
------------
* [java:openjdk-8-jdk-alpine](openjdk-8-alpine)
